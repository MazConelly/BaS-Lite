		<text>The Howa Type 20 Assault Rifle, referred to as the Type 20 5.56mm Rifle, is an ambidextrous assault rifle resistant to corrosion for exposure to seawater, developed for the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force by Howa. A small arms test was made by the JGSDF in 2018 to compare the HK416, SCAR-L, and Type 20. All three rifles satisfied the JGSDF's requirements of better environment durability, fire power and extensibility over the then-in-service Type 89, but the Type 20 received the highest score. It is speculated that the design was influenced by Japan's experience of procuring and utilizing a number of foreign rifles, and has been compared to the HK433 and the SCAR.\n
		The J-3 high-power cartridge, a 5.56 mm round made to be powerful enough to penetrate modern body armor despite the rifle's relatively short barrel length, was developed specifically for the Type 20.\n
		It remains a mystery why, how, and in what quantity this rifle came to the participants of a scientific expedition to the Zone.\n

		<text>The SR-556 is a semi-automatic AR-15 style rifle manufactured by Sturm, Ruger & Co. The rifle was introduced in 2009 in .223 Remington/5.56?45mm NATO and as a .308 Winchester AR-10 variant in 2013, the SR-762. It is one of several AR-15 rifles to use a gas piston operation. Ruger announced on May 15, 2009 on the SR-556 being produced, and in January 2016, Ruger discontinued all existing SR-556 rifles in preparation for a new takedown variant.\n
		Several of these rifles came to the Zone through the scientists. According to rumors, six small containers with these guns were sent from foreign sponsors to Professor Sakharov, but 5 of them were lost before arrival.\n
