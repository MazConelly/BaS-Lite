In common use since 1964 when it was introduced as a standard issue telescopic sight for SVD sniper rifle. The scope has been later adapted to assault rifles such as AK-74 or AN-94. Recognized for its durability, versatility and very well-designed reticle pattern featuring convenient range-finder scale. This particular scope has 4.0x magnification rate, making it usable mainly for combat at long ranges. It is attached to weapons by means of a dovetail mount, which is standard in Warsaw Pact countries.\n

Unlike zoom sights, the SpecterDR offers an optimized optical path and identical eye relief in both 4x and 1x modes.\n
		Depending upon the situation, the user may adjust the sight to illuminate the cross-hair or just a brilliant red dot in the center. In 1x mode, the SpecterDR has by far the largest field of view in the industry. In 4x mode the SpecterDR offers a generous field of view, long eye relief, and ELCAN’S legendary crystal clear image.\n

As it was technologically more advanced as well as lighter, the Russian military has chosen it over the PSO-3 as the standard optic for the SV-98. We offer an AA version with linearly marked elevation turrets, exclusively imported by Kalinka Optics It fits AK and SVD rifles and is optimized for use on SVD, Tigr, PSL Mosin and similar rifles. It's fully coated prismatic lens system provides a remarkable, high contrast, wide angle field of view and lower eyepiece location for comfortable aiming. The scope has an illuminated rangefinding reticle. The scope has POSP-style windage and elevation adjustments (every elevation turret' click moves POI by 4.5 cm at 100 m, every windage turret' click moves POI by 2.5 cm at 100 m). The special protective lens coatings protect the scope from scratching and fouling in the extreme battlefield conditions where it was designed to operate.
