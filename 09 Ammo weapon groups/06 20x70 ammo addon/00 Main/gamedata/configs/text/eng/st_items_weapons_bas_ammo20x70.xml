		<text>Standard 20-caliber shell filled with 5 6mm buckshot pellets. Highly lethal at close range. Due to the reduced powder charge it suffers from reduced power compared to 12 gauge shotguns. The lighter recoil makes it more popular for novice hunters. Only suitable for use with smoothbore weapons.</text>
