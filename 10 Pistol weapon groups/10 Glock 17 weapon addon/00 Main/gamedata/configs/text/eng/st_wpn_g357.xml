	<string id="st_wpn_g357_descr">
		<text>A classic polymer-framed, short recoil-operated pistol trusted by law enforcement officers and military personnel around the globe because of its unsurpassed reliability, optimal magazine capacity and low weight. The Glock 17 is easy to operate and maintain and is a versatile weapon that can be used for self-defense, target shooting, or combat situations.\n
		This one, however, has been modified to use the incredibly powerful .357 cartridge, turning an already efficient sidearm into a pocket-sized powerhouse.\n
