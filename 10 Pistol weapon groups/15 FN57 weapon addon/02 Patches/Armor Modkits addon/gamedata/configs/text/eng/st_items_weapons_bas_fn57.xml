		<text>The Five-seveN is a delayed blowback operated, semi-automatic firearm. The Five-seveN pistol was designed by FN Herstal as a complimentary sidearm for the P90 submachine gun. The P90 and Five-seveN share the same ammunition, the 5.7x28mm SS190 cartridge. The idea behind the ammunition and weapon is to provide good penetration against targets protected by body armour, while keeping the weapon's weight, dimensions and recoil at reasonable levels.\n
		The Individual Officer Model was the first model to be offered to civilian shooter, in 2004. It included a Picatinny accessory rail, a serrated slide and trigger guard, and fully adjustable sights. A LAM is already attached to this particular gun.\n
