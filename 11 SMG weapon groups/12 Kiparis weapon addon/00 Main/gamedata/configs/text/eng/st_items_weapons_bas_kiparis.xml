		<text>OTs-02 "Kiparis" (Cypress) is a sub-machine gun, developed in 1972 by order of the Ministry of Defence of the USSR by weapon designers from TsKIB COO of Tula. The layout is based on the Scorpion Vz.61. It uses a free bolt recoil and closed bolt, which increases the accuracy of fire. A folding stock is used can be folded on top of the receiver.	In the Zone, this weapon is not uncommon and usually used by bandits and loners who can't afford a better weapon.\n

		The technician Polimer considers himself a true fan of the old, but very affordable cartridge 9x18 in the southern regions of the Zone. His inexpensive improvements are very popular among stalkers in all factions in the Zone.\n
		This model differs from the standard mainly in some simple attachments and slightly increased rate of fire.\n
		%c[ui_gray_2]ATTACHMENTS:\n
		%c[d_purple] • %c[ui_gray_2] The cheapest laser sight available, Picatinny rail for attaching some small sights, handcrafted Bakelite foregrip. As a gift, Polymer gave you a set of 40 round mags.\n
