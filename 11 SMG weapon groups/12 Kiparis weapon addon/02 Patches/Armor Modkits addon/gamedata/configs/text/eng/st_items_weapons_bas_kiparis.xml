		<text>OTs-02 "Kiparis" (Cypress) is a sub-machine gun, developed in 1972 by order of the Ministry of Defence of the USSR by weapon designers from TsKIB COO of Tula. The layout is based on the Czechoslovak sub-machine gun Scorpion Vz.61 (1961 variant). The OTs-02 "Kiparis" automatic mechanism is powered by a free bolt recoil. Shots are fired from closed bolt, which increases the accuracy of fire. To increase stability of the weapon, a folding stock is used, which in the compact position is folded on top of the receiver. In the Zone, this weapon is not uncommon and usually used by bandits and loners who can't afford a better weapon.\n \n
