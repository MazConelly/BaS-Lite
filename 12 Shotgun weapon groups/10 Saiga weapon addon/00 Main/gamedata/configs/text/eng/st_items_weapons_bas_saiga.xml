		<text>A Saiga-12 modified during production at the request of the Ministry of Science and its personel. The expeditions of the ecologists puts both the researchers and their escorts at higher risk of encountering dangerous mutants. With suggestions from both their guards and mercenaries, simple but effective modifications were made to a basic Saiga-12 to improve its basic capabilities, giving it an edge over other shotguns against aggressive wildlife.\n

		<text>A Saiga-12 heavily modified for the use of mercenaries. Curiously similar to the modified samples shipped to the Ecologists, seems like it received further changes to make for a more effective warfare tool. A Picatinny rail and a massive muzzle brake compensator have been installed, significantly reducing recoil.\n
