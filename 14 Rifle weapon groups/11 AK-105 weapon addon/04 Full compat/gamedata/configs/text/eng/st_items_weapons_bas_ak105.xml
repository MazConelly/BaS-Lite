		<text>The AK-105 is a 5.45x39mm carbine version of the AK-74M rifle. The AK-105 is supplementing AKS-74U carbines in Russian Army service. Ideal for CQC (close quarters combat), it's not intended for long range combat. The rifle's reiver is made of stamped steel; the magazine is made out of reinforced fibreglass and the stock is made of hollow plastic, making it lighter, more durable, and allowing a field kit to be stored inside of it.\n

		<text>%c[ui_gray_1]A rare and not very popular body kit for the AK-105 due to its price. Very similar to kit used by Duty. It is found mainly among veterans of the Clear Sky group. The set includes: an extended fore-end, an ergonomic stock and a more comfortable pistol grip. In addition, the kit includes an improved trigger and three sighting devices that turn the weapon into an "ideal companion" at close and medium-long distances. Scopes (included): Elcan SpecterDR, Trijicon RMR calimator sight mounted at 45 degrees and AN/PEQ-15 LAM. The kit also includes a set of 45 rounds mags. This upgrade is irreversible.\n
