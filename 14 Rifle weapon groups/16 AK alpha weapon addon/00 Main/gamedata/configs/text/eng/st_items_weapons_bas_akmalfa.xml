		<text>Developed in Israel by Command Arms & Acessories (CAA), the AK-Alfa assault rifle was first presented to the public in 2016. This weapon is marketed under two brands - "Kalashnikov USA" and "Kalashnikov Israel".\n
		The AK-Alpha assault rifle is an attempt to improve the ergonomics of the AK rifle while maintaining its main advantages - high reliability and ease of maintenance. The base for the AK-Alpha is the receiver, the barrel with the gas tube, the bolt group and the main components of the trigger of the Russian-made Saiga carbine.\n
		It seems this weapon was brought to the Zone by the ISG faction.\n
