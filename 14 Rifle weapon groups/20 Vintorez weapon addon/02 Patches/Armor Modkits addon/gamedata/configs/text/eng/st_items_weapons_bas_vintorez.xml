	<string id="st_wpn_val_tac_descr">
		<text>The AS Val is widely used by Russian Army recon units, as well as by MVD (Internal Affairs Ministry) and FSB (Federal Security Bureau) Special Forces. The AS-VAL is a gas operated, integrally suppressed weapon. The receiver is machined from steel forging for improved strength. It has a standard side-mounted rail for optical, night vision or red dot scopes but has no provision for mounting a bayonet or a grenade launcher. The integral suppressor could be easily detached for maintenance, repair, or compact storage, but the rifle should not be fired with the suppressor removed due to safety and reliability issues.\n

		<text>The brainchild of the founder of Rifle Dynamics, Jim Fuller. The model is developed on the basis of the well-known and well-established VSS Vintorez. One of the main differences from the original is the presence of a special mechanism that allows you to fire with a misfire of two bullets and a picatinny rail installed along the entire length of the weapon. Used by ISG special units.\n

		<text>At the request of the Syndicate of Mercenaries, a team of enthusiastic scientists led by Professor Sakhorov was engaged in finalizing the prototype. To develop and conduct field trials, it took about 20 artifacts from gravitational anomalies. As a result, this allowed the Picatini bar to be installed on the receiver without loss of accuracy, as well as improved mechanics, which led to higher reliability indicators.\n

		<text>Designed at TsNIITochMash by Peter Serdyukov and his team, the new rifle was intended for various Spetsnaz troops of the Soviet Army, KGB and MVD. The VSS is quite popular among its users for its stealthy capabilities and the great lethality of the heavy 9x39mm bullets. The effective range of the VSS is limited to 300-400 metres. Standard sighting equipment consists of side rail on the receiver, which usually accommodates the 4x  PSO-1M2-1 scope. Any other scope or night vision sight can be mounted on the appropriate mount. Backup iron sights consist of tangent rear and blade front. The rear sight is graduated for up to 400 metres.\n
