	<string id="st_wpn_g28_descr">
		<text>The HK G28 rifle was developed by Heckler&Koch specifically for the Bundeswehr as a support weapon for small infantry units. The G28 is based on the HK MR308, which, in turn, is a civilian version of the HK 417 automatic rifle. Despite several differences, the HK G28 is 75% interchangeable with the HK 417. This rifle is designed to shoot at distances inaccessible to standard 5.56mm assault rifles.\n
		The Schmidt & Bender PM II 3-12x50 riflescope was originally created for elite military forces for high-quality target acquisition and pinpoint accuracy. The scope is outfitted with an illuminate Tremor2 reticle that offers a variety of markings to calculate precise shots while taking distance and windage into account.\n
